# 🌐 AIDD 30-Day Challenge - Task 02
## 📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)
### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
- Q1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
better for your growth as a system architect?

   AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) helps us with handle repetitive tasks like project integration, folder/file structure, resolve     bugs/errors etc. Rather than wasting my time and energy on boilerplate, installation steps and configuration,I can focus more on           architecture, planning and improve overall structure of the system. Which helps me grow stronger as a system architecture.

- Q2: Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer.

   Nine Pillars are the modern software development framework which include 9 powerful components (pillars) that makes an Integrated          system, goal of the system is to make a single developer as powerful that he can do all alone as an entire software team                    — Planning, coding, testing, deployment. Together, these Nine Pillars transform a normal developer into an M-Shaped Developer by          giving them multiple deep skills across coding, planning, testing, automation, AI integration, and deployment. Instead of depending on     a large team, the developer themselves becomes multi-skilled and highly productive.
  
### Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
- Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

   In vibe coding, there no planning,no specs, no written intent. After a few days code become impossible to maintain because new features    were added randomnly based on feelings. By doing this code becomes messy, unstructured which causes confusion, bugs and inconsistent       logic and the developer forgets what was built earlier.

- Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

   A specification is clear,written document that defines what a feature will do,how it will behave,which edge cases it will handle. SSD      helps to decide specification first before starting the project. The objective is clear and everyone knows what we have to do and why,     can change any function without hesitation which we have to face in vibe coding,

### Architecture Thinking
- Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

    Architecture-first thinking turns a developer into a system planner. Instead of jumping into code, the focus shifts to components,         workflows, layers, APIs, data flow, and responsibilities. Developers become designers who guide AI agents, not manual code generators.
  
- Q2: Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

    Developers must think in layers and systems because writing raw code or syntax is now AI's job. If a developer wants a task to be          completed correctly, they must first provide clear specifications for the AI to follow. If the specifications are not clear, AI may        not produce correct functions, and the system may not work. Raw coding creates short-term progress but long-term chaos.


## 📁 Part B — Practical Task
#### Task:
   Using any AI CLI tool, generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.
#### Requirements:
   -Must contain “@”  
   -Must contain a valid domain (e.g., .com, .org)   
   -Should return clear error messages   

#### CLI Prompt:
  Generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function that must contain “@”, must contain a valid domain such as .com or   .org, and should return clear error messages when validation fails.

##### Specification:
The email validation function will assess a given string to confirm its structural validity as an email address. The function must verify that the string contains exactly one "@" symbol, which serves to separate a non-empty local-part from a domain. The domain must also be non-empty and include a valid Top-Level Domain (TLD), such as ".com" or ".org", appearing after the final period. In cases where the input string fails any of these checks, the function will return a clear, descriptive error message specifying the nature of the failure—for example, "Email must contain an '@' symbol" or "Email is missing a valid domain extension." If the email string adheres to all the specified rules, the function will indicate successful validation.
