## 📂 PART A — Research Questions
#### Q1: What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
Gemini 3.0 bring major improvements in reasoning, multimodel understanding and developer tooling. It can combine text, images and long-      form input very well. Its reasoning is much stronger on difficult tasks and it supports "agentic" coding through tools like Google Antigravity, where AI can plan and do multi-step software work. It's also more secure.

#### Q2: How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Gemini 3 improves coding and automation workflows by allowing developers to plan, write, execute, and validate code through agentic “vibe coding,” backed by strong benchmark performance. Its platform, Google Antigravity, gives AI agents direct control over editors, terminals, and browsers, automating full development tasks while producing traceable artifacts. With a large context window and integration across studio, CLI, and cloud tools, it can handle complex codebases reliably and support multi-step project automation.

#### Q3: How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
Multimodal understanding = ability of the AI to interpret and reason using more than one type of data.   
For example:   
Text   
Images (photos, diagrams)   
Videos   
Possibly audio or other formats in the future

#### Q4: Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Gemini 3.0 introduced tools like Google Antigravity and Gemini CLI. Google Antigravity allows AI agents to plan and execute multi-step workflows using the editor, terminal, and browser, while Gemini CLI lets developers interact with Gemini 3 from the terminal to run tasks, generate code, and automate workflows efficiently.
